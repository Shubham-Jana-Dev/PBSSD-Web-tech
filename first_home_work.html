        <h3>Section 2: Technology</h3>
        <p>Leveraging the power of pure markup to structure the web is a vital skill. Understanding how tags function allows developers to create accessible content for everyone. In this assignment, I am focusing on semantic HTML, which helps search engines and screen readers interpret the data correctly. Technology is constantly evolving, and staying updated with the latest web standards is a key part of my learning journey.Hello, I am Shubham.

        <h3>Section 3: Community</h3>
        <p>Building a digital community requires more than just code; it requires a focus on user experience and engagement. This section represents the collaborative effort of students sharing resources and feedback. By working together, we can solve complex problems and create a more inclusive internet. I hope to use these skills to contribute to open-source projects and help others learn the art of web design in the future. Hello, I am Shubham.
